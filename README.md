# Problem 
Company X is an education center which sells courses on different topics. It runs Facebook ads to find participants into the courses. The companys marketing team wants to know how well the different ads are performing. 

# Plan 
The main question is how efficient is the campaign. For that, we calculate the return on investment = revenue from course signups divided by the cost of ads. 
We can also measure click-through-rate and compare it to historical average. This shows how well the ad itself is performing.
For data, a dummy dataset was created with OpenAI. Therefore, no data privacy laws need to be taken into consideration while using the solution.

# Data
