This project is about analyzing Facebook ads performance. Data is dummy data created with OpenAI.

# Research problem 
Company X is an education center which sells courses on different topics. It runs Facebook ads to find participants into the courses. The companys marketing team wants to know how well the different ads are performing. 

# Research plan 
The main question is how efficient is the campaign. For that, we calculate the return on ad spend = revenue from course signups divided by the cost of ads. 
We can also measure click-through-rate and compare it to historical average. This shows how well the ad itself is performing. 

# Business Glossary 
Return on ad spend - revenue from signups divided by the cost of the ad. 

# Data model and data glossary
This dataset includes one table with ads info. 

# Data lineage 
We take data from Facebook as a CSV file and upload it to Power BI.

# Power BI semantic model 
Power BI semantic model has 3 source tables: 
1) ads_dummy_dataset which has information coming from Facebook about the ads performance.
2) ads_paidcustomers table which has information on how many customers ended up paying for the course.
3) ads_courses has information on the price of the course.
